Should make a list view like shown in /mockUps
elements of mockup to notice:

swipe left on element shows delete (remove from current results)
swipe right on element shows share (share sheet - iOS. Also should use iOS share icon)

user should be able to select an element (indicated using the check mark on the right side of the element shown in mock ups)
later we will add a feature to do remove or share by selected and will also make it possible to select all or top x at once. do not implement this yet just add as a todo later.
the "stars" represented as circles /5 and not just filling full or half stars but the exact amount. the text next to the stars represents the number of stars 
The app and its interactable UI should follow the following colors RGB (light colors and dark colors regaurdless of name - other than red):
lightGreen = 214,240,230
mintGreen = 93,203,141
lightYellow = 246,235,208
sunYellow = 245,192,92
lightLavender = 223,226,243
vividLavender = 101,112,221
lightBlue = 220,236,247
oceanBlue = 74,158,238
red = 235,77,83
Color of circle under number result: 
**Given:**
the returned result from aesthetic score is -100 to 100, normalize this linearly as 0 (-100) to 5 (100) with 0 mapped to 2.5.
$$
\begin{aligned}
x &= 0 &\rightarrow& \text{Red} \quad (\text{Hue} = 0^\circ) \\
x &= 2.5 &\rightarrow& \text{Yellow} \quad (\text{Hue} = 60^\circ) \\
x &= 5 &\rightarrow& \text{Green} \quad (\text{Hue} = 120^\circ)
\end{aligned}
$$

We want a **linear hue interpolation** across $0 \le x \le 5$.

**Equation:**

1. **Normalize $x$ to the 0â€“1 range:**

$$
t = \mathrm{clamp}\left( \frac{x}{5},\ 0,\ 1 \right)
$$

2. **Hue calculation (degrees):**

$$
H = 120 \cdot t
$$

3. **HSL color:**

$$
\mathrm{Color}(x) = \mathrm{HSL}\left( H,\ 100\%,\ 50\% \right)
$$
