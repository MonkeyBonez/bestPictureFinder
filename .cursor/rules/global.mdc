## Clarify-First Policy
- Before creating or changing code/docs, ask targeted clarifying questions if anything is missing or ambiguous.
- Use [PLACEHOLDER] only when you must proceed; surface it back to me and request details.

## Meta-Rules (Rules about Rules)
- Rules live in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`. Content lives in `/docs/*.md` (or repo root for `spec.md`).
- Use `@file` to reference docs; do not inline large content.
- Do not overwrite `spec.md`, `design_spec.md`, or `meeting_notes.md` without confirmation.
- Precedence when interpreting guidance: `design_spec.md` > `spec.md` (PRD) > `meeting_notes.md` > `task_list.md`. If any conflict exists, pause and ask.

## Core Context Files
@file ../spec.md
@file ../docs/meeting_notes.md
@file ../docs/task_list.md
@file ../docs/design_spec.md  # optional; keep even if file doesn’t exist yet

## Planner → Executor Protocol
- For non-trivial requests:
  1) Propose a brief step-by-step plan listing files to edit/create.
  2) Wait for my approval.
  3) Implement in small chunks, then re-check the plan.

## Meeting Notes — Create & Maintain
- If `../docs/meeting_notes.md` does not exist, create it with sections: Decisions, Patterns, Gotchas.
- When we agree on a new decision/pattern/gotcha, ask to append a dated bullet to the correct section.
- If the file grows large (~250+ lines), propose pruning and move the oldest items to `../docs/meeting_notes_archive.md` (create if missing) with a short monthly summary.

## Task List — Create & Maintain
- If `../docs/task_list.md` does not exist, create it with sections: Objective, Tasks (checkbox list), Notes.
- Keep exactly one active feature at a time; review tasks before coding.
- Mark completed items; propose new subtasks (ask first). When done, propose archiving the list.

## Scope Guards
- Only touch files explicitly approved in the current plan.
- Don’t introduce new directories, broad refactors, or renames without confirmation.

## No-Hallucination Safeguards
- If any required detail (paths, API names, constraints) is unknown, ask before acting or use [PLACEHOLDER] and request details.

## Building & Testing
After making any code changes build the project (do not run it) and check for errors - if there are any, attempt a fix if you are confident in what to do.
